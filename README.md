## Background
SpaceX, a leader in the space industry, strives to make space travel affordable for everyone. Its accomplishments include sending spacecraft to the international space station, launching a satellite constellation that provides internet access and sending manned missions to space. SpaceX can do this because the rocket launches are relatively inexpensive ($62 million per launch) due to its novel reuse of the first stage of its Falcon 9 rocket. Other providers, which are not able to reuse the first stage, cost upwards of $165 million each. By determining if the first stage will land, we can determine the price of the launch. To do this, we can use public data and machine learning models to predict whether SpaceX – or a competing company – can reuse the first stage.

## Executive Summary
The research attempts to identify the factors for a successful rocket landing. To make this determination, the following methodologies where used:
* **Collect** data using SpaceX REST API and web scraping techniques
* **Wrangle** data to create success/fail outcome variable
* **Explore** data with data visualization techniques, considering the following factors: payload, launch site, flight number and yearly trend
* **Analyze** the data with SQL, calculating the following statistics: total payload, payload range for successful launches, and total # of successful and failed outcomes
* **Explore** launch site success rates and proximity to geographical markers
* **Visualize** the launch sites with the most success and successful payload ranges
* **Build Models** to predict landing outcomes using logistic regression, support vector machine (SVM), decision tree and K-nearest neighbor (KNN)

# Methodology

## Data Collection -
* Using SpaceX Rest API
* Using Web Scrapping from Wikipedia

## Data Wrangling
* **Convert outcomes** into 1 for a successful landing and 0 for an unsuccessful landing
* Filtering the data
* Dealing with missing values
* Using One Hot Encoding to prepare the data to a binary classification

## EDA with Visualization
* **Create charts** to analyze relationships and show comparisons

## EDA with SQL
* **Query the data** to understand more about the data

## Maps with Folium
* **Create maps** to visualize launch sites, view launch outcomes and see distance to proximities

## Dashboard with Plotly Dash
* **Create dashboard**
* Pie chart showing successful launches
* Scatter chart showing Payload Mass vs. Success Rate by Booster Version

## Predictive Analytics

## Results

### Exploratory Data Analysis:
* Launch success has improved over time
* KSC LC-39A has the highest success rate among landing sites
* Orbits ES-L1, GEO, HEO, and SSO have a 100% success rate

### Visualization / Analytics:
* Most launch sites are near the equator, and all are close to the coast

### Predictive Analytics
* All models performed similarly on the test set. The decision tree model slightly outperformed when looking at .best_score_

# Conclusion
* **Model Performance:** The models performed similarly on the test set with the decision tree model slightly outperforming
* **Equator:** Most of the launch sites are near the equator for an additional natural boost - due to the rotational speed of earth - which helps save the cost of putting in extra fuel and boosters
* **Coast:** All the launch sites are close to the coast
* **Launch Success:** Increases over time
* **KSC LC-39A:** Has the highest success rate among launch sites. Has a 100% success rate for launches less than 5,500 kg 
* **Orbits:** ES-L1, GEO, HEO, and SSO have a 100% success rate
* **Payload Mass:** Across all launch sites, the higher the payload mass (kg), the higher the success rate
